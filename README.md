# CS-210
# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
What was needed for this project was to create a produce-tracking program to determine how many of each item is being sold each day. Menu options were added to allow the user to display different amounts of data for either tracking one item or all the items together. 
# What did you do particularly well?
I believe I did particularly well with the while loop that was created to display which options the user has and what each option does. This loop also validates user input and displays an error message when they type in the wrong input.
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
To enhance my code I could probably make the main function of the program a bit more condensed. I could also probably add more data members to the private members list.
# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
I found it difficult to write the code for maps in order to read the data needed from the file. I overcame this by watching youtube videos with explanations on how it works, and by reading a section in zbooks describing maps. 
# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
The skills used in this project that will be transferble to more course work are the use of while and for loops. And the use of reading and writing to files. The use of maps is also beneficial for reading certain data from files.
# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I added in line comments so other users can see what is going on. I also seperated the code within different functions as to not clump everything up. I also used proper naming conventions for each of the variables.
